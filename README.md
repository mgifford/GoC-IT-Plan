# GoC-IT-Plan
Government of Canada Information Technology Strategic Plan 2016-2020 - Community Remix

The Government of Canada has created a strategic plan that falls short of understanding the role of open-source software in Open Government. You can see the original here http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/hgw-cgf/oversight-surveillance/itpm-itgp/it-ti/gcitsp-tigcps-eng.asp

The community here believes that we should be using modern, open, transparent, internet enabled tools to build policies like this. We can follow the model started in the UK & USA to use proper version control to allow people to propose improvements and fork the code base if they want to explore other options. 

If you fork this code base and take it another way, make sure to email tbs-sct@tbs-sct.gc.ca with the changes so that they are aware what you feel is important.

You might be satisfied showing up in a “What We Heard” summary report published months after the final report, or you can just do it in GitHub so that it is available for anyone searching for it.
