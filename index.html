	<h2 id="cio">Message from the Chief Information Officer of the Government of Canada</h2>
	<p>The Government of Canada’s Information Technology Strategic Plan 
sets out the four-year strategic direction for information technology 
(IT) in the federal government. In responding to government priorities 
and current challenges, the plan charts the path forward for IT from a 
whole-of-government or “enterprise” perspective, positioning the 
government to manage and use IT as a strategic asset, in innovative 
ways, to deliver better programs and services and ultimately value to 
Canadians. </p>
	<p>Developing this plan provided the opportunity to assess our progress
 and reconfirm the Government of Canada’s commitment to the continued 
enterprise transformation of IT. The goal of this transformation is to 
enable improved and easier access to government services by business and
 individuals in ways that meet their expectations for a responsive, 
modern and secure digital government. In developing this plan, we also 
looked at what other jurisdictions are doing to organize internal 
capacity  to drive innovation in digital services. We will consider 
various models as we explore new approaches to utilize internal capacity
 to meet our current and future needs.</p>
	<p>At its core, the plan is intended to guide federal organizations and
 the IT community on IT priority setting and decision-making. This is 
why it includes actions to strengthen the current enterprise governance,
 a key to our success going forward. </p>
	<p>This plan will also inform Shared Services Canada’s (SSC’s) 
direction and priorities as SSC revises and implements the plan to renew
 the Government of Canada’s IT infrastructure. The strategic actions 
outlined in this plan include both current commitments and activities, 
as well as new enterprise directions, some of which may require 
additional approvals or funding to be fully implemented. Regardless of 
their status, the directions outlined provide important guideposts for 
departments and agencies as they develop their individual IT plans and 
prioritize their IT investments. </p>
	<p>Not all actions set out in this plan are expected to be completed by
 2020. Neither is it expected that all departments and agencies will 
implement these actions within the same time frame. Some actions may not
 be applicable or appropriate for all departments, most notably small 
departments and agencies. Deputy heads, in consultation with the 
Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS), will take this into 
consideration when implementing the strategic plan.</p>
	<p>I extend my sincere thanks to the Government of Canada’s Chief 
Information Officer (CIO) community and many other federal partners who 
helped us build this strategic plan. Through careful planning and 
cooperation within the Government of Canada enterprise, we can achieve 
the IT vision and meet the strategic goals outlined in this document.</p>
	<p>John Messina</p>
	<p>Chief Information Officer of the Government of Canada</p>

<section>
	<h2 id="toc1">Executive Summary</h2>
	<p>Traditionally, government organizations have set up and run their 
own IT infrastructure and services in order to carry out their 
respective mandates. Over the last few years, the Government of Canada 
has taken the first steps to transform its approach to IT infrastructure
 and service delivery. These steps have included initiatives to 
transform the “back office” services provided to employees, such as 
human resources, financial services and records management, and to 
provide IT infrastructure, email, data centres and network services 
across government through Shared Services Canada.</p>
	<p>This IT strategic plan builds on the lessons learned from these 
initiatives, and seizes on the opportunities created by technologies 
such as social media, mobile devices, analytics and cloud computing to 
fully maximize the benefits of an enterprise approach to IT. This plan 
will deliver to Canadians the kind of government they expect – one that 
is open and transparent yet safeguards their personal information, one 
that delivers effective and responsive programs and services while being
 fiscally prudent, and one that makes decisions based on sound evidence 
while seeking meaningful engagement and collaboration with Canadians and
 other stakeholders.</p>
	<p>To deliver on these citizen expectations, employees require modern 
and effective tools for their day-to-day work. They demand a modern 
workplace with digital tools that are integrated, collaborative and 
efficient. Along with these requirements, constantly evolving technology
 and the need to protect vital data and information from malicious cyber
 threats, make it essential that we renew our aging and mission-critical
 IT systems. At the same time, we must balance the growing demand for IT
 services with realistic capacity limitations. </p>
	<p>Building on these key drivers, the overarching goals of <strong>service, security, value</strong> and <strong>agility </strong>set
 the direction for the strategy. The Government of Canada is committed 
to responsive and &nbsp;innovative IT services that meet business needs 
and enhance the end-user experience, to a secure and resilient 
enterprise infrastructure that enables the trusted delivery of programs 
and services, to smart investments across the board that ensure 
high-value and cost-effectiveness, and to an agile, connected and 
high-performing workforce with modern tools. Four strategic areas of 
action will achieve these goals over the next four years and 
beyond.&nbsp; Each area of focus, Service IT, Secure IT, Manage IT, and 
Work IT details specific actions and activities that are currently 
underway or that represent new enterprise directions. </p>
	<p>The first, <strong>Service IT</strong>, calls for the use of cloud 
computing, information-sharing platforms, and technologies and tools to 
manage service delivery and improve client satisfaction. These actions 
are necessary in order to develop a modern, reliable and sustainable IT 
infrastructure that allows for the secure sharing of information. This 
in turn will ultimately result in better internal services for 
government employees and improved external services for Canadians and 
other users.</p>
	<p>The second area, <strong>Secure IT</strong>, focuses on layered 
defences to reduce exposure to cyber threats, increased awareness and 
understanding to proactively manage these threats, and protective 
measures to enable the secure processing and sharing of data and 
information across government.&nbsp; These actions will ensure that 
Canadians and others who access online services trust the government 
with their personal information.</p>
	<p>The third area, <strong>Manage IT</strong> presents a strengthened 
governance approach, the evolution of IT management practices, process 
and tools and a focus on innovation as well as sustainability. 
Implementing these strategic actions will ensure that IT investments are
 sustainable, take advantage of economies of scale, and demonstrate 
value by helping departments deliver on their mandates.</p>
	<p>The fourth area, <strong>Work IT</strong>, introduces actions to 
build a high-performing IT workforce and a modern workplace that 
provides public service employees with the tools they need to do their 
jobs. This is vital because the Government of Canada’s employees are its
 greatest asset when it comes to delivering the kind of government that 
Canadians want.</p>
	<p>Progress towards achieving the strategic goals outlined in the IT 
strategic plan will be tracked, evaluated and reported. As it evolves, 
the government’s IT strategic plan will require the government to make 
investment choices. It will be reviewed yearly to ensure it stays up to 
date and relevant, supported by an implementation roadmap to track and 
report on progress (Appendix A). Departments and agencies through their 
investment plans, will detail how this enterprise approach will be 
implemented in their organization. </p>
	<p>With this strategic plan, the Government of Canada has set out a 
clear path to getting the maximum benefit out of the money it spends on 
IT. Implementing this agenda is crucial to ensuring that the Government 
of Canada is ready and able to meet the needs and expectations of 
Canadians in the years ahead.</p>

	<h2 id="toc2">Introduction</h2>
	<div class="well well-md col-md-3 pull-right mrgn-lft-md">
		<p>IT services in the Government of Canada are delivered by <strong>17,000 IT professionals</strong> working in more than <strong>1,500 government locations</strong> across Canada and around the world. </p>
		<p>The government’s <strong>total annual spending on IT is $5 billion</strong>, an amount that has been stable over the past 5 years.</p>
		<p>Government departments spend <strong>$3 billion</strong> annually on applications, computing devices and IT program management.</p>
	</div>
	<p>The Government of Canada is made up of more than 100 separate 
organizations that deliver a broad range of programs and services to 
individuals and businesses in Canada and abroad. IT supports the 
government in delivery of these programs and services. In the past, many
 operated their own IT infrastructure and services to carry out their 
respective mandates. Increasingly, the disadvantages of this approach 
have become apparent. Inefficiency, duplication and IT-systems 
incompatibility have hindered the ability of government decision-makers 
to get the high-quality, real-time information they need to deliver 
excellent results.</p>
	<p>A whole-of-government, or “enterprise” approach to IT infrastructure
 and service delivery is addressing these short-comings. The 
responsibility for delivering IT services to core departments and 
agencies is now shared between central providers such as Shared Services
 Canada (SSC) and Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC). Cyber 
and IT security is the shared responsibility of SSC, the Communications 
Security Establishment (CSE) and Public Safety Canada. The Chief 
Information Officer Branch (CIOB), of Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS) 
supports Treasury Board by developing strategy, setting government-wide 
policy for IT and cybersecurity, and providing implementation guidance. </p>
	<p>Today’s business environment continues to be characterized by 
disruption and the imperative to do more, faster, with less. In our 
digital era, individuals, business and others who interact with 
government have high standards for the services they receive. The 
Government of Canada is transforming how government works so that it 
better reflects the values and expectations of its clients.</p>
	<p>This IT strategic plan supports the continued transformation to 
enterprise IT infrastructure and service delivery and proposes to 
address these and other challenges by responding to the following key 
drivers:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Citizen expectations</li>
		<li>Workplace and workforce evolution</li>
		<li>Security</li>
		<li>The enterprise approach</li>
		<li>Aging IT and sustainability</li>
	</ul>
	<section>
		<h3>Citizen expectations </h3>
		<p>Canadians want and deserve technology that provides the best 
service to them, when and where they need it, and in a client-centric 
manner. They want to be assured that departments and agencies are using 
the best available data to make evidence-based decisions with respect to
 policies, programs and services that affect everyone. They value 
government that is open with its data and other business information yet
 protects their privacy.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Workplace and workforce evolution </h3>
		<p>Internal clients, including employees, expect modern and effective 
tools that connect up to make their day-to-day work efficient and 
provide value-added to their efforts. They demand a digital experience 
that is optimized, integrated and diversely client-centric. Employees in
 a modern workplace need digital tools that promote collaboration, 
information sharing and increased productivity.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Security </h3>
		<p>Cybersecurity is an ever-evolving aspect of any information 
technology strategy. While bringing important opportunities, the 
consolidation of systems leads to a greater attack surface that requires
 enhanced security measures to minimize risks. Inconsistent management 
of government networks and the security profiles of government endpoint 
devices – computer devices capable of connecting to the Internet – also 
has the potential to increase the risk of cyber-attack. </p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>The enterprise approach </h3>
		<p>Sharing our infrastructure, and using common IT solutions to meet 
common needs, is one part of leveraging technology in a 
whole-of-government, or enterprise, approach, along with addressing 
security, privacy, accessibility, and open information requirements.</p>
		<p>For IT users, it will be important to ensure a consistent end-user 
experience government-wide, regardless of geographical location. Issues 
of latency, bandwidth, security, infrastructure and other considerations
 need to be taken into account. As well, the complexity of IT-enabled 
projects is increasing as we move toward a more horizontal delivery 
model. Authoritative governance is needed to make enterprise decisions 
about IT investments. </p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Aging IT and sustainability </h3>
		<p>There is a continued need to renew the government’s aging and 
mission critical IT infrastructure and systems that are at risk of 
breaking down. IT infrastructure transformation is proceeding slower 
than anticipated; complexity of the task has caused some delays and 
procurement is taking longer than planned. Funding pressures are 
arising, in part, from stronger than forecasted growth in demand. 
Chronic under investment puts the government’s ability to deliver some 
essential services to Canadians at risk. While progress has been made to
 rationalize applications, current system health indicators signal more 
work is needed to address this risk.</p>
	</section>
</section>
<section>
	<h2 id="toc3">The Vision</h2>
	<p>The provision of secure, agile and reliable IT services delivers 
improved productivity and streamlined, high quality government services 
that are simpler and easier to access, where and when our clients want 
them. </p>
	<p>Aging IT risks have been reduced through the completion of the IT 
infrastructure transformation and implementation of models and processes
 to ensure sustainable funding to address IT renewal. IT platforms that 
are the backbone for information sharing, big data analytics and 
collaboration, enable the use of high quality government data to inform 
decisions and identify innovative approaches to public policy. The use 
of enabling technologies such as cloud computing and social media offer 
more ways to engage with Canadians and others.</p>
	<p>Through proactive measures, the government has reduced the threat 
surface of internet-connected networks and improved controls regarding 
access to government-held information. Enhancing government network and 
system security ensures that Canadians and others assessing online 
services can trust the government with their personal information.</p>
	<p>IT investment that is targeted at business priorities drives greater
 efficiency and encourages innovation by government and third parties. 
Better management of IT investment maximizes value and reduces service 
delivery costs, enabling the government to respond more rapidly to 
emerging issues. </p>
	<p>The government is served by a high performing, strategically minded 
IT workforce who enjoy exciting career opportunities in the federal 
government. The Public Service is highly connected, and technology 
integrates seamlessly into daily work life. IT allows people to work 
smarter and solve problems more effectively by providing secure, agile 
and reliable systems and tools for information sharing, collaboration, 
and innovation. </p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2 id="toc4">Mission Statement</h2>
	<p>Federal information technology professionals are strategic partners 
within our organizations, providing excellence in IT services and 
delivering secure, reliable and agile technology. Working 
collaboratively with stakeholders and across government, our efforts add
 value in the workplace and contribute to better programs and services 
for Canadians.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2 tabindex="-1" id="toc5">Guiding Principles</h2>
	<p><strong>Principle 1: Enable a modern workplace: Anywhere, anytime, with anyone</strong></p>
	<p>The Government of Canada strives to be an innovative organization 
that provides its employees with modern technology that supports 
information sharing, collaboration, and that will attract, retain and 
encourage public servants to work smarter, be innovative, greener and 
healthier so that they may better serve Canadians. </p>
	<p><strong>Principle 2: Think “enterprise” first</strong></p>
	<p>Where an enterprise solution exists to meet a common business need, 
departments and agencies should stop investing in departmental legacy 
versions and refocus efforts, resources and funds on becoming ready to 
adopt the enterprise solution and on accelerating its delivery.</p>
	<p><strong>Principle 3: Use cloud computing services </strong></p>
	<p>Departments and agencies should explore Software as a Service (SaaS)
 cloud computing services before developing solutions in-house. Cloud 
computing services are to be procured through SSC, which will act as the
 Government of Canada’s cloud service broker.</p>
	<p><strong>Principle 4: Meet common business needs through shared solutions</strong></p>
	<p>Departments and agencies should actively seek out opportunities to 
pool resources inter-departmentally to address common business needs.</p>
	<p><strong>Principle 5: Examine options</strong></p>
	<p>Where an enterprise solution to meet a common business need does not
 exist, departments and agencies should examine potential solutions 
taking into consideration total cost of ownership, ability to meet 
current and future business requirements, interoperability and assessing
 internal capacity.</p>
</section>
<section>
	<h2 id="toc6">Strategic Goals</h2>
	<p>The overarching strategic goals of <strong>service</strong>, <strong>security</strong>, <strong>value</strong>, and <strong>agility</strong>
 along with the mission statement set the direction for the IT strategic

		<p>The more open, transparent and integrated government programs and 
services become, the more they will depend on IT to deliver secure and 
reliable services that meet agreed upon expectations.</p>
		<section>
			<h4>Develop IT service portfolios and catalogues <span class="label label-info">Actions underway</span></h4>
			<p>An IT service portfolio describes services in terms of business value, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A list of services </li>
				<li>A description of how they are bundled or packaged</li>
				<li>The benefits they deliver</li>
			</ul>
			<p>An IT service catalogue is a list of available technology 
resources and offerings within an organization. It is a tactical, 
operational tool that is intended to make it easier for clients to 
request IT services on a day-to-day basis.</p>
			<p>SSC and PSPC will develop IT service portfolios and service 
catalogues that clearly articulate enterprise service expectations for 
the services they provide, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Roles and responsibilities</li>
				<li>Service targets </li>
				<li>Associated reporting commitments</li>
			</ul>
			<p>SSC and PSPC will price their services to facilitate the introduction of:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Chargeback models</li>
				<li>Price comparisons of external service providers</li>
				<li>The adoption of cloud services</li>
			</ul>
			<p>With respect to IT security, SSC will establish expectations and 
provide the necessary information to partners for the IT infrastructure 
that it manages.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Report on key areas of IT system health performance <span class="label label-info">Actions underway</span></h4>
			<p>Key performance indicators that focus on operational excellence 
and delivery are critical tools in managing the delivery of IT services.
 Departments and agencies will put in place metrics for monitoring 
client satisfaction and key areas of IT system performance (e.g., 
security, availability, reliability and capacity). </p>
			<p>For the services they provide, SSC and PSPC will:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Set enterprise-wide service-level expectations in collaboration with departments and agencies</li>
				<li>Report to departments and agencies on performance based on these expectations</li>
				<li>Engage their clients to resolve issues if service levels fall below targets</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Implement enterprise IT service management tools <span class="label label-info">Future actions</span></h4>
			<p>IT service management (ITSM) refers to an organization’s planning,
 delivery, operations and control of IT services offered to clients. 
Departments and agencies traditionally have implemented their own ITSM 
tools. These tools are expensive to implement and maintain, and the 
diversity of tools affects overall ITSM efficiencies. Moreover, service 
request and trouble tickets do not flow easily within and between 
organizations. </p>
			<p>SSC will put in place enterprise ITSM tools and make them 
available to all departments and agencies. This will bring consistency 
to the practice of ITSM and, more importantly, reduce the cost and 
delays of fulfilling service requests.</p>

			<h4>Complete data centre consolidation and modernization <span class="label label-info">Actions underway</span></h4>
			<p>The Government of Canada operates over 500 aging data centres that
 support mission-critical and non-mission-critical business functions. 
Consolidating these data centres into fewer modern and secure data 
centre services is the most cost-effective way to address the 
government’s “rust out” issue. These enterprise data centres will be 
designed with the ability for backup and retention, as part of disaster 
recovery plans and in support of business continuity.</p>
			<p>SSC will enable the migration of departmental legacy applications 
to segregated partner-specific locations (called enclaves) within the 
new enterprise data centres. This migration will accelerate the closure 
of aging data centres, enhance data security and minimize the financial 
and business impact to organizations. </p>
			<p>To ease the demand for data centre capacity, departments will 
reduce the number of back office applications to be migrated. The extent
 to which the government leverages external cloud service providers 
could also reduce the requirement for data centre capacity. </p>
			<p>Successfully consolidating data centres depends on departments’ 
readiness to prepare their applications for migration within prescribed 
timeframes. Departments and agencies will work with SSC and other 
government and external partners to ensure that:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Mission-critical and other applications are in appropriate environments</li>
				<li>These applications are supported with appropriate technologies and procedures to ensure their availability</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Complete network consolidation <span class="label label-info">Actions underway</span></h4>
			<p>To streamline and modernize the government’s network 
infrastructure and services, SSC will eliminate unused phone lines and 
migrate departments from outdated and costly legacy phone systems to 
wireless devices and VoIP service.</p>
			<p>SSC will also work with departments and agencies to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Consolidate the 50 existing SSC partner wide-area networks into a single enterprise network</li>
				<li>Establish shared network infrastructure in office buildings that house multiple departments</li>
				<li>Secure and reduce the number of connections to the Internet</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Complete government email consolidation <span class="label label-info">Actions underway</span></h4>
			<p>Departments and agencies have traditionally operated their own 
email systems, leading to business and cost inefficiencies. Departments 
and agencies will reduce the size of employees’ mailboxes. SSC and 
departments and agencies will work to complete the task of consolidating
 email services to a common system. </p>

		<h3 id="toc7-2">Cloud computing</h3>
		<p>Cloud computing, or on-demand computing, provides access to shared 
computing resources (e.g. networks, servers, storage, applications, and 
services). This capacity is provided using “pay for use” models, similar
 to those used for traditional utilities such as water or electricity. </p>
		<p>Cloud computing eliminates the need to buy hardware or software. 
This allows governments to move from a capital expense model to an 
operational expense model. Moreover, cloud computing is best positioned 
to satisfy the substantial need for agility and scalability of today’s 
unpredictable business environments. </p>
		<p>In the context of cloud, enterprise-wide and shared solutions, 
departments and agencies have a duty to apply safeguards that will 
enable them to retain uncompromised control over information they have 
collected or created. </p>
		<section>
			<h4>Adopt cloud computing services <span class="label label-info">Actions underway</span></h4>
			<p>TBS will publish the Government of Canada’s Cloud Adoption 
Strategy to guide the adoption of cloud computing services in a cost 
effective and secure manner. Departments and agencies will choose cloud 
computing services from a number of options that will include extensions
 to existing legacy solutions and private and public cloud offerings. In
 making these choices, departments and agencies will need to consider:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Privacy</li>
				<li>Security</li>
				<li>Compliance</li>
				<li>Data residency and sovereignty</li>
				<li>Vendor lock-in considerations</li>
				<li>Commercial risk</li>
				<li>Latency and performance</li>
				<li>Data transfer</li>
				<li>Integration</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Departments and agencies will consider solutions that employ 
Software as a Service (SaaS) before Platform as a Service (PaaS) and 
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). </p>
			<p>To ensure Canada’s sovereign control over its data, departments 
and agencies will adopt the policy that all sensitive or protected data 
under government control will be stored on servers that reside in 
Canada. Departments and agencies will evaluate risks based on an 
assessment of data sensitivity, and apply the appropriate security 
controls for cloud services. </p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Establish a cloud service broker <span class="label label-info">Actions underway</span></h4>
			<p>A cloud service broker (CSB) functions as a bridge between 
organizations and cloud providers. Using a CSB makes cloud services less
 expensive, easier, safer and more productive for organizations to 
navigate, integrate, consume and extend cloud services, particularly 
when services span multiple and diverse providers.</p>
			<p>A CSB’s key functions are procurement, billing, security 
accreditation, networking, credential and identity federation, 
application integration, customer support, and vendor service-level 
agreements (pertaining to management and skills).</p>
			<p>SSC will create and operate a “light-touch” CSB role that includes
 all these functions, including access to SaaS, PaaS, IaaS and 
marketplace (online storefront) services.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Offer public cloud services <span class="label label-info">Actions underway</span></h4>
			<p>A public cloud refers to a cloud environment shared by multiple 
tenants that are isolated from each other. SSC will direct its efforts 
toward acquiring and brokering multiple enterprise-grade public cloud 
services. Several of these will have a presence in Canada with the 
capability to store and process protected data. Public cloud services 
will be the priority choice for departments and agencies when choosing a
 cloud deployment model.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Offer private cloud services <span class="label label-info">Future actions</span></h4>
			<p>A private cloud has the attributes of a public cloud, except that 
the services are for use by a single enterprise, in this case the 
Government of Canada. The cloud’s hardware, storage and networks are 
dedicated to a single client and typically require capital investment. </p>
			<p>Private clouds can be implemented as pre-engineered commercial 
offerings or as tailored solutions engineered and assembled by staff. 
SSC will direct its efforts toward acquiring the former, with the latter
 being implemented when unique requirements arise. Departments and 
agencies will use private clouds where needs cannot be met by public 
clouds.</p>

		<h3 id="toc7-3">Information sharing</h3>
		<p>Interoperable platforms are the backbone of data and information 
sharing, big data analytics and collaboration. By seizing on these 
opportunities, government can create a modern workplace in which 
employees have the enabling tools needed to keep pace with the 
expectations of the Canadians and businesses they serve. </p>
		<section>
			<h4>Build a platform for enterprise interoperability <span class="label label-info">Actions underway</span></h4>
			<p>Enterprise interoperability fosters openness and collaboration. To
 strengthen digital business and promote integrated business services 
among enterprise systems, TBS, PSPC, and SSC will create a set of modern
 integration tools called the GC Interoperability Platform. This 
platform will act as an information broker, enabling the exchange of 
data and information between back-office enterprise systems and 
organizational applications.</p>
			<p>The platform will feature a service bus and a message fabric, 
built and operated by PSPC and SSC. The service bus will connect 
enterprise applications for integrated business needs and the message 
fabric provides the messaging infrastructure that connects and enables 
communication between components. The two features will combine to 
provide a dedicated, secure and high-speed information access layer, 
allowing organizations to easily share data. </p>
			<p>Government application programming interfaces (GAPIs), a single 
language used across siloed business systems, will allow for 
interoperable business by using common information exchange standards. 
TBS will lead the creation of common and approved GAPIs from “single 
sources of the truth” to support information sharing within government. 
TBS will also establish governance for enterprise interoperability and 
information sharing.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Introduce a government mobile applications store <span class="label label-info">Future actions</span></h4>
			<p>Canadians and business want to use mobile applications to interact
 with government data and obtain government services. TBS will lead the 
creation of mobile application stores that enable digital distribution 
of easy-to-use and trusted mobile applications.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Introduce a government API store <span class="label label-info">Future actions</span></h4>
			<p>An application programming interface (API) is a set of routines, 
protocols and tools for building software applications. An API specifies
 how software components should interact and how APIs are to be used in 
programming user interfaces. APIs are increasingly becoming the way to 
facilitate sharing of government data and information. TBS will lead the
 creation of an API store to support information sharing with Canadians,
 business and other entities external to government.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Implement a platform for external collaboration <span class="label label-info">Future actions</span></h4>
			<p>Technology makes it easier for citizens, academia, scientists, 
businesses and government to share ideas and information and to 
collaborate with one another. TBS will lead the establishment of an 
external collaboration service provider to host departments and to 
provide them with a dedicated workspace and computing storage for 
unclassified and transitory data. Cloud pilot projects will test-drive 
requirements and determine the most suitable platform to meet government
 business, information and security needs.</p>
			<p>TBS, in collaboration with departments, agencies, PSPC and SSC, 
will provide departments and agencies with a secure platform to share 
opinions, information and analyses, and to collaborate with external 
partners, academia, businesses, other governments and citizens.</p>
			<p>While meeting the government’s requirements for security 
classification, disposition and recordkeeping, the platform will support
 an array of functions such as document sharing, co-authoring, tasks, 
meetings and discussions.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Advance analytics capabilities <span class="label label-info">Future actions</span></h4>
			<p>Business intelligence involves creating, aggregating, analyzing 
and visualizing data to inform and facilitate business management and 
strategy. Analytics is about asking questions and refers to all the ways
 in which data can be broken down, compared and examined for trends. 
“Big data” is the technology that stores and processes data and 
information in datasets that are so large or complex that traditional 
data processing applications can’t perform analysis. Big data can make 
available almost limitless amounts of information, improving data-driven
 decision-making and expanding open data initiatives.</p>
			<p>TBS, working with departments and agencies, will lead the 
development of enterprise data analytics requirements. SSC, under TBS 
leadership and direction, will work with departments and agencies to 
implement an enterprise analytics platform that takes advantage of big 
data and market innovation to foster better analytics and promote 
collaboration.</p>

		<h3 id="toc8-1">Defence in depth</h3>
		<p>Canada’s competitive advantage, our economic prosperity and our 
national security depend upon government adopting new and accessible 
technologies to better serve Canadians and public service employees. If 
not managed well, however, making information and data more open could 
risk exposing networks, systems, devices and data, including personal 
information, vulnerable to malicious or accidental breaches. This is 
just one reason why strengthening IT security is paramount. </p>
		<section>
			<h4>Secure the government’s network perimeter <span class="label label-info">Future actions</span></h4>
			<p>Though the Internet is a game-changer for the ease with which 
public service employees can access and share information, it also 
brings considerable risk. Malicious software (malware) can be 
unknowingly downloaded from websites or through email and seriously 
compromise IT systems and disrupt government operations.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>To protect the government’s network, world-class monitoring 
services and defensive measures have been implemented at the 
government’s network perimeter through SSC-managed gateways. The 
completion of network consolidation projects will ensure that all SSC 
partners use these gateways. There remain, however, organizations that 
continue to use non-SSC networks to access the Internet. </p>
			<p>To address risks to the network, the Government of Canada is 
standardizing protection and creating a secure, government-wide network 
perimeter. Departments and agencies that do not currently use SSC 
Internet services will be migrated to the SSC-managed enterprise network
 and will use SSC Internet services exclusively. </p>
			<p>TBS, CSE and SSC will establish additional Trusted Interconnection
 Points (GC-TIPs) between the government network and external partners 
to provide standardized and secure connectivity with external partners, 
the Internet, and to act as a gateway to cloud computing services.</p>
			<p>These actions will reduce the risk of rogue, ad hoc or 
unauthorized Internet connections to and from government networks. They 
will also enhance the government’s ability to defensively monitor data 
entering or exiting the government perimeter, and so ensure maximum 
protection of government information assets.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Implement endpoint security profiles <span class="label label-info">Future actions</span></h4>
			<p>Malicious parties frequently seek out exposed or misconfigured 
Internet-facing services or equipment to gain access to IT systems or 
information. Endpoint devices such as laptop computers, tablets and 
servers provide a doorway for these kinds of threats. Malware, rootkits 
and phishing can lead to the loss and compromise of government data, 
including personal information. Operating systems and applications that 
use default configuration settings typically include unnecessary 
components, services and options. These default settings are well known 
and easily discovered using automated tools.</p>
			<p>In the enterprise context, weaknesses and misconfigurations in an 
organization’s systems could be exploited and used to attack other 
organizations’ systems. Making the government’s endpoint devices more 
resistant to attacks is key to securing the government enterprise.</p>
			<p>Recognizing the risk posed by misconfigured endpoint devices, SSC,
 in consultation with TBS and CSE, will develop endpoint device 
profiles. These standardized profiles will be based on security best 
practices, and will represent securely configured operating systems and 
applications. The profiles will be validated and refreshed regularly to 
update their security configuration. Additional security controls, such 
as host-based intrusion prevention and application whitelisting – a 
computer administrative practice used to prevent unauthorized programs 
from running – will be implemented to further ensure the integrity of 
systems and information. </p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Implement an enterprise approach to vulnerability and patch management <span class="label label-info">Future actions</span></h4>
			<p>The government must ensure that vulnerabilities are identified and
 remediated quickly to minimize the risk of future intrusion and 
potential loss. TBS and SSC will implement an enterprise-wide 
vulnerability and patch management capability to systematically detect 
and remediate vulnerabilities. Departments and agencies will implement 
these tools and processes, meet standard timelines for remediation, and 
ensure quick response times for emergency or critical patch deployment. </p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Manage and control administrative privileges <span class="label label-info">Future actions</span></h4>
			<p>Organizations also need to manage internal risks to the security 
of their IT. Privileged accounts (such as local or domain administrators
 and other accounts with elevated access) are the most powerful accounts
 in any organization and are also the most targeted by malicious parties
 that wish to compromise government information. </p>
			<p>TBS, SSC and departments and agencies will work together to 
minimize the misuse of any account with elevated privileges, either 
malicious or accidental. Tools and processes will be implemented to 
ensure the proper management, control and monitoring of such accounts. 
These will include establishing strong authentication mechanisms for all
 privileged accounts. </p>
			<p>Departments and agencies will also implement measures to manage 
and control the life cycle of and access to privileged accounts, 
including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Audits and reviews to confirm validity of privileges</li>
				<li>Continuous monitoring to look for uncharacteristic behaviour </li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Protect web transactions to and from external-facing websites <span class="label label-info">Actions underway</span></h4>
			<section>
				<div class="well well-md col-md-3 pull-right mrgn-lft-md">
					<h5>What is GCKey?</h5>
					<p>GCKey is a standards-based authentication service provided by 
the Government of Canada. It provides Canadians with secure access to 
online information and government services and assists Canadian federal 
government departments in managing and controlling access to their 
on-line programs through standardized registration and authentication 
processes. </p>
					<p>The GCKey Service issues a GCKey, which is a unique, anonymous 
credential that protects communications with online Government programs 
and services. The GCKey service can be used for those who do not have, 
or choose not to use, their online banking credentials with a Sign-in 
Partner (SecureKey Concierge).</p>
				</div>
			</section>
			<p>As more Canadians interface electronically with the Government of 
Canada, the amount of sensitive information transferred to and from 
government websites will increase. To maintain maximum trust in these 
online transactions, the government must protect them.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>TBS will establish an “HTTPS everywhere” standard that will 
require departments and agencies to use the HTTPS protocol for all 
external-facing websites and cloud services. This protocol, along with 
approved encryption algorithms, will ensure the secure transmission of 
data online and the delivery of secure web services. </p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Implement an improved cyber authentication service <span class="label label-info">Future actions</span></h4>
			<p>Currently, Canadians and others external to the government can 
securely access government services online using a trusted credential. 
The credential (i.e., a username and password) is either issued by the 
Government of Canada’s GCKey service or by a private sector organization
 that has partnered with SecureKey Technologies to enable their 
customers to use their online credentials (such as card numbers or user 
names and passwords) to access Government of Canada services. </p>
			<p>This mandatory solution for all online government applications 
offered to the public is cost-effective, secure and convenient for 
users. Still, improvements to the existing cyber authentication service 
are needed to support new initiatives such as Canada’s Digital 
Interchange. Building on the existing solution and maintaining a 
pan-Canadian approach, TBS and SSC will develop a renewed cyber 
authentication service. This service will meet current business needs 
yet support enhanced functionality required for future federated 
identity and digital service delivery initiatives.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Implement a trusted digital identity for people accessing internal government networks and systems <span class="label label-info">Actions underway</span></h4>
			<p>TBS will complete an enterprise-wide approach to internal identity, credential and access management to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Reduce costs</li>
				<li>Promote interoperability</li>
				<li>Improve end-user experience (by reducing the need for multiple user IDs and&nbsp; passwords)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Under TBS leadership, SSC will implement common internal identity 
and credential processes and technologies tailored to the level of 
assurance required for a particular business process. For example, a 
unique digital identity will be needed to authenticate employees, 
contractors, trusted guests or any other authorized users accessing 
internal government networks and systems.</p>
			<p>Departments and agencies will migrate applications to this new 
enterprise service when their applications are upgraded as part of 
regular asset life cycle maintenance. </p>
		</section>

			<h4>Implement a secure communication service for classified information <span class="label label-info">Future actions</span></h4>
			<!--<div class="well well-md col-md-3 pull-right mrgn-lft-md">
				<p>Shared Services Canada, under the  strategic direction of the Treasury Board Secretariat and supported by Communications  Security Establishment, will implement a single, common and integrated  enterprise-wide secret-level network to enable classified data to be  securely transmitted, stored and processed across departments and agencies.</p>
			</div> -->
			<p>Every day, departments and agencies create, store and process 
classified information. Failure to protect this information could lead 
to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>National security risks</li>
				<li>Economic losses </li>
				<li>Loss of government credibility </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Although several special environments allow some organizations to 
safely share classified information, there is no common solution 
available government-wide.</p>
			<p>SSC, under the strategic direction of TBS and supported by CSE, 
will implement a single, common and integrated enterprise-wide 
secret-level network to enable classified data to be securely 
transmitted, stored and processed across departments and agencies. 
Classified voice and mobile capabilities will also be implemented for 
users who need to regularly discuss classified information. </p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Implement enterprise data loss prevention <span class="label label-info">Future actions</span></h4>
			<p>With its responsibility for maintaining large amounts of sensitive
 data, the government needs to minimize the risk of unauthorized 
disclosure. TBS will establish a framework to support an enterprise 
approach to data loss prevention. Preventing the unauthorized transfer 
or release of sensitive information involves first identifying sensitive
 data. Unauthorized data flows and operations will be monitored, 
detected and blocked. SSC, with departments and agencies, will implement
 the framework.</p>
		</section>

		<h3 id="toc8-3">Awareness and understanding</h3>
		<p>Understanding the assets within an IT environment is essential to 
knowing what to protect and enables the government to be more proactive 
and efficient when responding to threats and attacks.</p>
		<section>
			<h4>Enable comprehensive understanding of endpoint devices <span class="label label-info">Future actions</span></h4>
			<p>It is critical to be able to proactively and accurately determine 
the status of all endpoint devices, what is running on them and who is 
accessing them. In this way, endpoint devices that pose a risk to the 
enterprise can be identified, allowing the government to become more 
effective when responding to threats and attacks.</p>
			<p>Under TBS leadership, SSC, and departments and agencies will 
acquire and implement tools and processes to enable a real-time, 
enterprise view of the current status and configuration of government 
endpoint devices. This includes information on:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Hardware and software versions</li>
				<li>Operating system versions </li>
				<li>Patch installations</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Enhance awareness of enterprise cyber threat and risk environment <span class="label label-info">Future actions</span></h4>
			<p>Departments and agencies are accountable for managing cyber risks 
to their particular program areas. However, as the government adopts an 
enterprise approach and programs and services become more integrated, it
 will be imperative that cyber risks are also managed at the enterprise 
level.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>Key to effective enterprise risk management is understanding the 
changing cyber-threat landscape (e.g., who is trying to exploit 
government networks and systems, by what means, and for what purpose). </p>
			<p>TBS will establish a centralized capability to continuously 
monitor and analyze the enterprise cyber-risk landscape. This monitoring
 will pull together data from multiple sources, e.g. threat assessments,
 risk registers, investment plans, audit results, critical asset 
listings, etc., to feed a consolidated enterprise view of cyber risks. 
One of the key data sources will be the GC Enterprise Threat Assessment,
 which CSE will refresh on an ongoing basis to keep pace with evolving 
internal and external cyber-threat environments. </p>
			<p>The continuous monitoring of the cyber-threat and -risk landscape 
will inform decision-making and influence how corrective actions are 
prioritized across the enterprise to ensure maximum protection of 
government assets.</p>

		<h3 id="toc9-1">Governance</h3>
		<p>To fully embrace an enterprise IT approach, departments and 
agencies need clear direction on agreed-upon priorities and approved 
approaches, which comes from an authoritative source. Oversight is 
required to ensure sustained progress in advancing shared objectives. 
Roles and responsibilities must be documented for effective 
implementation of an IT governance structure.</p>
		<section>
			<h4>Establish enterprise IT governance <span class="label label-info">Actions underway</span></h4>
			<!--<div class="well well-md col-md-3 pull-right mrgn-lft-md">
				<p>The Deputy Minister and Assistant Deputy Minister Committees on Enterprise Priorities and Planning (CEPP) will encourage departments and agencies to move toward enterprise IT solutions for consolidated services. CEPP will establish the &#8220;rules of engagement&#8221; for adopting enterprise IT solutions and services, including the process for addressing exceptions.</p>
			</div> -->
			<p>Adopting an enterprise approach requires sound governance 
structures that support clear and informed decision-making. The Deputy 
Minister and Assistant Deputy Minister Committees on Enterprise 
Priorities and Planning (CEPP) will be the governance and oversight 
bodies for all government IT investments.</p>
			<p>CEPP will encourage departments and agencies to move toward 
enterprise IT solutions for consolidated services. CEPP will establish 
the “rules of engagement” for adopting enterprise IT solutions and 
services, including the process for addressing exceptions. As such, CEPP
 will approve all implementation plans for enterprise services. </p>
			<p>CEPP will manage demand from departments and agencies for SSC IT 
infrastructure services, and guide how SSC provides those supply-side 
services. SSC will report to CEPP on its progress with transformation 
efforts. Through principles-based prioritization and a risk-based 
approach to balancing demand and supply, CEPP will align IT and 
IT-enabled initiatives with enterprise business priorities. </p>
			<p>In addition, CEPP will provide direction for and oversee the 
implementation of the Government of Canada IT Strategic Plan. The 
Committees’ Terms of Reference, including mandates, authorities and 
accountabilities, have been updated accordingly.</p>
			<p>All the business needs of government will be managed according to IT governance principles. Under CEPP leadership, TBS will:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Clearly define the key roles of business owner, service provider and client</li>
				<li>Clarify how existing governance structures will be integrated with the IT governance structure</li>
				<li>Determine an appropriate decision-making process</li>
				<li>See that departments and agencies avoid duplication or unnecessary overlap</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Develop methods to prioritize investments in legacy and transformation initiatives <span class="label label-info">Actions underway</span></h4>
			<div class="well well-md col-md-3 pull-right mrgn-lft-md">
				<p>The Deputy Minister and Assistant Deputy Minister Committees on 
Enterprise Priorities and Planning (CEPP) endorses four IT investment 
principles which guide departmental investment strategies ensuring they 
reflect business and enterprise priorities.</p>
				<ul class="list-unstyled">
					<li>Principle 1: Think “Enterprise” first</li>
					<li>Principle 2: Use cloud computing services</li>
					<li>Principle 3: Meet common business needs through shared services </li>
					<li>Principle 4: Examine options</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<p>SSC and PSPC will develop and define methods with which to measure
 the progress of transformation initiatives, aligning them with key 
benefits. Progress must be reported clearly and reliably.</p>
			<p>SSC, supported by TBS and departments and agencies, and under the 
oversight and direction of CEPP, will develop a methodology to 
prioritize and allocate funding for investments in legacy and 
transformation initiatives. SSC will also develop a clear process to 
address funding deficiencies. Methodologies and processes will be 
refined periodically to ensure accurate determination and reporting of 
savings. CEPP endorses a principles-based approach to guide departmental
 investment strategies ensuring they reflect business and enterprise 
priorities. New or significant changes to IT and IT-enabled projects 
will be subject to consultation with TBS and approval by CEPP.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Document roles and responsibilities for IT and IT security <span class="label label-info">Future actions</span></h4>
			<p>Departments and agencies have a role in managing and delivering 
IT, as described in Appendix D. TBS will work to elaborate and document 
the roles and responsibilities of departments and agencies, SSC, PSPC 
and central agencies for delivering IT services and implementing the 
government’s IT strategic plan so that they are clearly defined, 
communicated and executed. TBS will also continue to provide clear 
direction to departments and agencies on IT security roles and 
responsibilities. These include security-control objectives and other 
security-related requirements.</p>
		</section>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3 id="toc9-2">Practices</h3>
		<p>Sound IT management starts with consistent planning based on 
documented descriptions of the enterprise. With an understanding of 
what’s in play, IT managers can adopt solutions that best address their 
business needs.</p>
		<section>
			<h4>Evolve IT management practices, processes and tools <span class="label label-info">Actions underway</span></h4>
			<p>CIOs should plan and execute departmental IT plans in a way that 
aligns with the government’s IT strategic plan and overall enterprise 
modernization priorities. Important tools to support them include: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Investment plans</li>
				<li>Architectural reviews</li>
				<li>Application Portfolio Management</li>
				<li>Expenditure Reporting</li>
				<li>Performance Reporting</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Optimizing IT investments to meet business outcomes will propel 
the evolution of IT management processes and tools. TBS policy and 
guidance will allow departments and agencies to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Manage IT consistently and with greater maturity </li>
				<li>Better understand IT at the enterprise level </li>
				<li>Benchmark themselves against similar organizations </li>
				<li>Monitor and track progress against government priorities </li>
				<li>Set future priorities </li>
			</ul>
			<p>TBS will also provide policy guidance to assist departments and agencies:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Develop sound project cost estimates </li>
				<li>Implement good project management practices in the area of complex IT projects</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Develop enterprise architectures for business and information <span class="label label-info">Actions underway</span></h4>
			<p>Describing the enterprise allows us to understand how government 
processes work. Enterprise architectures show where there are 
similarities and differences in business units, programs and 
departmental boundaries. </p>
			<p>IT enterprise architectures show: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>What IT systems are in use</li>
				<li>How IT systems interact</li>
				<li>How mission-critical business applications are deployed across the government’s IT infrastructure</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Understanding enterprise architecture enables effective 
decision-making about IT investments, costs and risks. It allows us to 
optimize performance and deliver on government priorities in the digital
 era.</p>
			<p>Working with functional communities, TBS will lead the development of an enterprise architecture framework.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Adopt agile approaches to implementing IT solutions <span class="label label-info">Actions underway</span></h4>
			<p>Departments and agencies will take advantage of existing 
multi-departmental contracts when investing in solutions to meet common 
needs. In cases where multi-departmental contracts or tools do not meet 
identified business requirements, departments and agencies will contact 
TBS to discuss other options. Departments and agencies are required to 
keep TBS up to date on their investments and plans.</p>
			<p>Where a customized or in-house solution is the only choice, 
application development teams should adopt modern agile approaches that 
deliver greater speed and agility. They must also take into account the 
increasingly complex IT ecosystem of interdependent software 
architecture, infrastructure and processes. </p>
			<p>Departments and agencies will promote a learning culture that allows IT solutions architects and developers to: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understand and adopt iterative development approaches, automate 
release schedules and embrace a layered testing strategy, including 
automated testing </li>
				<li>Increase engagement with business colleagues to advance iterative approaches</li>
				<li>Adopt an approach that considers a service-oriented architecture
 (SOA) and application programming interface (API) first, rather than 
monolithic constructs </li>
			</ul>

		<h3 id="toc9-3">Innovation</h3>
		<p>The Government of Canada is transforming its IT to better serve 
Canadians, with innovation key to delivering on this agenda. Successful 
innovation combines creativity with process to transform novel ideas 
into business enablers that deliver tangible results. It embraces 
experimentation and intelligent risk taking, bringing new approaches 
which address existing problems and leverage future opportunities. 
Innovation calls for collaboration both with new and traditional 
partners, identifying and breaking down any barriers that prevent us 
from achieving maximum results.</p>
		<section>
			<h4>Lead innovation <span class="label label-info">Future actions</span></h4>
			<p>The role of CIOs is evolving from service provider to full 
strategic business partner. These leaders are innovation agents, 
business enablers, and catalysts for enterprise transformation. 
Departmental CIOs will be strategic business partners who bring IT 
innovations to the table to address the organization’s business needs.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Adopt modern and flexible business models <span class="label label-info">Future actions</span></h4>
			<p>To achieve a better balance between demand and capacity, SSC and 
PSPC will fully adopt cost-recovery business models for all IT services.
 As an enterprise, departments and agencies will achieve better business
 value by sharing IT resources, capacity and capabilities.</p>
		</section>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3 id="toc9-4">Sustainability</h3>
		<p>Ensuring that IT investments are sustainable and meet business 
needs will enable departments and agencies to deliver better services to
 Canadians.</p>
		<section>
			<h4>Ensure IT infrastructure sustainability <span class="label label-info">Future actions</span></h4>
			<p>A sustainable funding model must take into account the regular 
renewal cycle of IT infrastructure assets with the appropriate level of 
investment. TBS and SSC will explore alternative financial models to 
address IT renewal. </p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Rationalize investments <span class="label label-info">Future actions</span></h4>
			<p>In keeping with CEPP investment principles, spending on new or 
significant changes to certain IT and IT-enabled projects will be 
subject to consultation with TBS and approval by CEPP. This includes 
spending on systems for common business domains such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Case management</li>
				<li>Information management</li>
				<li>Human resources management</li>
				<li>Financial management</li>
				<li>Other back office administrative processes</li>
				<li>Identity and credential solutions</li>
				<li>IT infrastructure and associated solutions</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Departments and agencies will take an enterprise approach to 
managing their portfolio of applications to determine opportunities for 
common, government-wide solutions, as well as retire aging and at-risk 
applications. Those applications that remain in use, supporting 
mission-critical business functions, are to be kept evergreen until they
 can be replaced by modern solutions.</p>

		<h3 id="toc10-1">IT workforce</h3>
		<p>Successfully delivering IT services requires a skilled, agile, 
connected and high-performing IT workforce that combines a knowledge of 
business and technology. IT professionals need to be able to keep pace 
with the speed at which technology is evolving. To enable a 
high-performing, strategic IT workforce will require continued 
investment in career and talent management. </p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>Invest in executive talent management <span class="label label-info">Actions underway</span></h4>
		<p>Talent management reviews and succession planning identify key 
skills gaps and mitigation strategies for the enterprise as a whole. 
Such efforts are supported by the 2016 Management Accountability 
Framework, which includes talent management indicators for CIOs and IT 
assistant deputy ministers.</p>
		<p>Departments and agencies will support enterprise-wide IT executive talent management and succession planning by: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Identifying sources of new talent to address gaps</li>
			<li>Identifying and creating opportunities at various levels</li>
			<li>Promoting and fostering the leadership and strategic partner component of the new and emerging CIO role</li>
			<li>Encouraging and facilitating learning and assignment opportunities for CIOs and aspiring CIOs</li>
			<li>Encouraging CIOs to explore diversified career paths, both within and outside IT organizations.</li>
		</ul>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>Enhance workforce planning <span class="label label-info">Actions underway</span></h4>
		<p>Building on efforts to better understand the workforce in the IT 
community, departments are developing three-year departmental workforce 
strategies. These strategies will serve as a foundation for workforce 
planning. To support successful business outcomes, they will align with 
the departments’ human resources plans and the government’s enterprise 
approach for IT.</p>
		<p>TBS will leverage this work in order to provide enterprise-level analysis that will identify:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Shifts and gaps in workforce complement and competencies</li>
			<li>Emerging issues</li>
			<li>Strategic opportunities</li>
		</ul>
		<p>TBS will work with departments and agencies to explore new 
approaches to utilize internal capacity to meet current and future 
needs.</p>
		<p>TBS will continue to evolve tools to support workforce planning and
 to project workforce requirements in the future. One such example is IT
 Community Generics, a suite of tools to help CIOs and IT managers 
direct IT resources in a way that reflects best practices in IT 
organizational design. IT Community Generics facilitate an enterprise 
approach to managing IT human resources. </p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>Enable career development <span class="label label-info">Actions underway</span></h4>
		<p>IT professionals need to be well positioned to support CIOs in 
their evolving role as strategic business enablers and partners. 
Competency tools, available through IT Community Generics, support 
computer science (CS) career development. Career-development materials, 
including career-related research on GCpedia, will further enable IT 
professionals to identify career paths and required competencies.</p>
		<p>TBS will lead the development of an internal skills inventory of 
the public service IT workforce and make it available to departments and
 agencies.</p>
		<p>Working with government and private sector stakeholders, including 
industry associations, TBS will share best practices, identify trends 
and support IT career development. The Canada School Public Service will
 design new learning products that target new and non-traditional skills
 for IT professionals. </p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h4>Promote gender parity <span class="label label-info">Future actions</span></h4>
		<p>An innovative workplace demands a workforce that accurately 
represents the full breadth of the Canadian talent pool. Currently, IT 
remains predominantly a male domain. &nbsp;Recent data reveals that 
women occupy only 27% of all CS positions in the Government of Canada. 
What’s more, the percentage of women in younger cohorts has diminished 
steadily to a low of 13% in the under-30 age group.</p>
		<p>To support the government’s commitments to gender parity and a 
balanced and diverse workforce, departments and agencies will develop 
and leverage partnerships with organizations that encourage IT as a 
career choice for young women. TBS will work with these organizations 
and with post-secondary institutions to ensure that women in IT 
programs, as well as potential candidates, are aware of job 
opportunities in the field. Departments and central agencies will also 
work to increase labour mobility among women by encouraging leaders from
 within the public service, as well as the private sector, to consider 
roles within the government’s CIO community.</p>
		<p>To retain women within the IT community, departments and agencies 
will encourage developmental opportunities such as internships and 
mentorships. TBS will develop communications to raise awareness of 
opportunities for women to develop, advance and participate fully in the
 IT workforce. </p>
		<p>Initiatives such as the Women in Communications and Technology 
Public Sector Network, a government-wide forum designed to engage women 
in IT, provide opportunities for women to network and take advantage of 
professional development programs.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3 id="toc10-2">Modern workplace</h3>
		<p>Technology is a key enabler of a modern workplace that supports 
collaboration, innovation and mobility. Ensuring that smart technology 
provides a consistent, accessible workplace experience throughout 
government will improve how all employees work together and deliver 
better services to Canadians. </p>
		<section>
			<h4>Modernize workplace technology devices <span class="label label-info">Actions underway</span></h4>
			<p>Workplace technology devices are essential for a modern workplace 
and a collaborative, mobile workforce, consistent with the Blueprint 
2020 vision. TBS will work closely with departments and agencies to 
ensure that workplace technology devices meet the Blueprint 2020 vision.</p>
			<p>TBS will establish enterprise standards and processes for life 
cycle management and set direction to guide future workplace technology 
devices standards and configurations. </p>
			<p>SSC will continue to consolidate contracts and procurement 
activities to improve security, reduce costs and improve service to 
Canadians. SSC will procure workplace technology devices, and work with 
TBS, and departments and agencies to standardize devices. </p>
			<p>Departments and agencies are responsible for support and 
maintenance of workplace technology devices. They will explore support 
models such as self-service and regional clusters, to reduce costs while
 promoting consistent user experience and service expectations.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Support a mobile workforce <span class="label label-info">Actions underway</span></h4>
			<p>The Government of Canada is committed to and encourages an open 
and collaborative work environment where mobile devices are used. 
Departments and agencies will balance the cost of these devices, and 
their support, against the business value achieved. </p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Provide Wi-Fi access <span class="label label-info">Actions underway</span></h4>
			<p>Access to wireless data networks is critical for employee 
productivity. The broader deployment of Wi-Fi may also reduce costs by 
displacing the need to provide wireline infrastructure, which is 
expensive to install and maintain.</p>
			<p>TBS and SSC will put in place the necessary services and policies 
to support Wi-Fi usage. Departments and agencies will implement Wi-Fi 
access to data networks for all employees within common areas and their 
workspaces, where the job requires mobility. Departments and agencies 
will migrate to Wi-Fi-capable devices and support Wi-Fi access to local 
area networks for registered users, as well as Wi-Fi guest-network 
access where security requirements are appropriate. </p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Provide desktop videoconferencing to employees <span class="label label-info">Actions underway</span></h4>
			<p>Increased access to videoconferencing supports the collaborative 
operations of virtual teams across organizations, time zones and 
regions. Departments and agencies will complete the re-engineering of 
their in-house videoconferencing facilities to enable full 
interconnectivity across the government. Where appropriate, and where 
the user profile supports such functionality, SSC will also create the 
network and bandwidth capacity needed to support videoconferencing at 
desktops. </p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Implement managed print services <span class="label label-info">Actions underway</span></h4>
			<p>The Government of Canada will continue to improve the 
sustainability of workplace operations by completing the implementation 
of the Office of Greening Government Operations’ strategy for printing. 
Departments and agencies will achieve an 8:1 average ratio of office 
employees to printing units. Departments and agencies will also use 
SSC’s managed print services to facilitate improvements to their 
organizations’ environmental efficiencies in imaging, specifically, 
reduced energy costs and paper consumption and proper disposal of 
electronic equipment.</p>
		</section>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3 id="toc10-3">Digital collaboration tools</h3>
		<p>Digital collaboration refers to the skills and mindset needed to 
work effectively in an open digital environment. Tools that respect 
government requirements such as accessibility, privacy, security, 
information management and official languages will be used to promote 
digital collaboration.</p>
		<section>
			<h4>Promote digital literacy and collaboration <span class="label label-info">Future actions</span></h4>
			<p>Digital literacy goes beyond basic computer skills. And it’s 
essential to make the most of investments already made in IT 
infrastructure, devices and tools and to ensure that IT helps workforce 
productivity rather than detracts from it.</p>
			<p>Public service employees should be able to use GCTools such as 
GCpedia, GCconnex and GCintranet channels to share information and to 
build the professional networks needed to respond to shifting priorities
 and problems. Collaborating digitally involves “working out loud,” 
where others can see, benefit from and help improve how employees work.</p>
			<p>To promote a culture of openness and collaboration, departments 
and agencies will nurture these skills throughout public service by:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Adopting and using GCTools for everyday work</li>
				<li>Deploying targeted and general learning and community outreach activities</li>
				<li>Promoting the use of self-directed learning tools and materials</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Senior leaders’ adoption of GCTools will be critical to 
successfully integrating digital collaboration into their organizations 
and to demonstrating the full benefits of these collaborative tools. 
Leaders will adopt an “open first” attitude toward content creation and 
encourage their employees to participate in shared-knowledge and 
collaborative digital spaces, other than where security requirements 
prohibit this.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4>Advance digital collaboration <span class="label label-info">Actions underway</span></h4>
			<div>
				<p>The Ambassadors Network consists of volunteers from various 
departments and regions that provide support to teams on the use of 
GCpedia and GCconnex.</p>
			</div>
			<p>GCTools such as GCpedia, GCconnex and the GCintranet channels 
enable collaboration across the government. Employees are able to access
 and share information and work across departments, agencies and 
geographic boundaries, resulting in better service to Canadians.</p>
			<p>GCTools that support government requirements on accessibility and 
official languages will be further developed and integrated into other 
applications. This will allow employees to easily connect with the 
colleagues and information they need to work effectively. GCTools will 
connect to a digital workspace that provides simplified access to other 
activities such as staffing, learning and professional development.</p>
			<p>TBS will make adopting GCTools part of standard practices for 
employee onboarding throughout government. Departments will then be in a
 better position to adopt and use GCTools through the Ambassadors 
Network and in formal training and ongoing communications.&nbsp; The 
Ambassadors Network consists of volunteers from various departments or 
regions that provide support to teams on the use of GCpedia and GCconnex
 to enhance their work.</p>
			<p>Departments and agencies will decommission standalone 
collaborative platforms unless they are linked to core local business 
requirements. Email communication will be reduced in favour of open 
discussions or in favour of instant messaging, where transitory 
communications can occur without bogging down government systems. </p>

	<h2 id="toc11">The Way Forward</h2>
	<section>
		<h3>Implementing the plan</h3>
		<p>In support of the Government of Canada, the Deputy Minister 
Committee on Enterprise Priorities and Planning (CEPP) will provide 
oversight and guidance on government IT investments, supported by the 
Assistant Deputy Minister (ADM) CEPP. An implementation roadmap for the 
plan’s initiatives has been developed (Appendix A) and financial 
analysis is underway to help determine the extent and pace of 
implementation, particularly in terms of infrastructure modernization. 
This roadmap will be refined as planning advances.</p>
		<p>Guided by CEPP, TBS will work with SSC, PSPC and departments and 
agencies to prioritize the elements of the plan and, as these 
initiatives are more fully developed, approved and funded, to implement 
them. Not all actions set out in this plan will be completed by 2020 and
 some actions may not be appropriate for all organizations, most notably
 small departments and agencies. Deputy heads, in consultation with TBS,
 will take this into consideration when preparing their own IT 
strategies.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Risks and mitigation strategies</h3>
		<p>The following risks to implementation and their mitigation strategies are identified:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Lack of capacity (people):</strong></dt>
			<dd> There is a risk that the government will not have sufficient capacity to implement the plan. <strong>Mitigation:</strong>
 Some strategic actions are identified as directional and can be 
deferred until sufficient capacity is available. CEPP (governance) will 
provide direction and oversee the implementation of the plan. </dd>
			<dt><strong>Too much to do:</strong></dt>
			<dd> There is a risk that the plan is overly ambitious and that the government will not be able to absorb all the new work. <strong>Mitigation:</strong>
 Some strategic actions are identified as directional and can be 
deferred until sufficient capacity is available. CEPP (governance) will 
provide direction and oversee the implementation of the plan.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Insufficient funds:</strong></dt>
			<dd> There is a risk of insufficient funding to implement all strategic actions identified in the plan. <strong>Mitigation:</strong>
 Strategic actions that are identified as directional will not proceed 
until funding is secured. Those currently underway will be assessed to 
ensure sufficient funding is available to complete implementation.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Failure to adopt the enterprise approach:</strong></dt>
			<dd> There is a risk that departments and agencies will not all act in an enterprise manner. <strong>Mitigation:</strong>
 CEPP will encourage departments and agencies to move toward enterprise 
IT solutions for consolidated services and address exceptions. </dd>
			<dt><strong>Retiring IT workforce/skills gaps:</strong></dt>
			<dd> There is a risk that the government will not retain its IT 
workforce due to increasing retirements and gaps in required skills. <strong>Mitigations:</strong>
 impacts could be avoided by actions to enhance workforce planning, 
enable career development, promote gender parity, and invest in 
executive talent management.</dd>
			<dt><strong>Significant cyber event:</strong></dt>
			<dd> There is a risk that a significant cyber security event could occur, delaying implementation of the plan. <strong>Mitigation:</strong>
 the impact of such an event could be reduced through measures such as 
securing the network perimeter, implementing security profiles for 
endpoint devices to reduce malicious threats, implementing vulnerability
 and patch management, and enhancing enterprise-wide awareness of the 
government’s cyber threat and risk environment.</dd>
		</dl>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Measuring progress</h3>
		<p>CEPP will provide direction and oversight of the implementation of 
the Government of Canada IT Strategic Plan including the monitoring of 
enterprise-wide implementation risk. &nbsp;</p>
		<p>Progress towards achieving the strategic goals outlined in the IT 
strategic plan will be tracked, evaluated and reported. Key performance 
indicators (KPIs) have been identified for strategic actions and are 
shown in Appendix B. The indicators will be reviewed in 2016 and revised
 as required. Benchmarks and targets will also be established in 2016, 
in consultation with departments and agencies, and leveraging existing 
assessment frameworks and tools, such as the Management Accountability 
Framework, key performance indicators for internal services, and 
departmental priorities and performance reports. </p>
		<p>CEPP will track the overall progress of the strategic plan and a 
yearly progress report will be provided to the Secretary of the Treasury
 Board.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h3>Staying evergreen</h3>
		<p>On an ongoing basis, CEPP will assess progress, consider the 
strategic plan’s effectiveness and align resources with priorities to 
get the intended results. The plan will also be kept evergreen through 
annual reviews. The first update to the plan is scheduled for June 2017.
 Going forward, updates will be aligned to the annual departmental IT 
planning cycle and completed in September to allow departmental IT plans
 to reflect new directions.</p>
		<p>Advised by CEPP, TBS will make adjustments where necessary to ensure that the strategic direction:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Remains relevant and aligned with government priorities</li>
			<li>Addresses IT issues</li>
			<li>Keeps pace with the ever-changing technology landscape</li>
			<li>Assigns appropriate accountabilities</li>
		</ul>
		<p>By ensuring a strategic, whole-of-government approach to the 
Government of Canada’s information technology investments, we will drive
 better service to Canadians, ensure our networks and information are 
more secure, and deliver better value for money. We will enable the 
public service to deliver its best for Canadians.</p>

	<h2 id="toc15">Appendix D: Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
	<p><strong>The Government of Canada</strong> is made up of over 100 
separate organizations that deliver a broad range of programs and 
services to individuals and businesses in Canada and abroad. Its 
programs and services are categorized into four spending areas: Economic
 Affairs, Social Affairs, International Affairs, and Government Affairs.
 IT supports the government in delivering these external-facing programs
 and services.</p>
	<p><strong>The Secretary of the Treasury Board</strong> sets 
government-wide strategic direction for IT, with input from organization
 deputy heads, chief information officers (CIOs) and other stakeholders.
 The responsibility for delivering IT services is shared between 
government organizations and central IT service providers such as Shared
 Services Canada (SSC) and Public Services and Procurement Canada 
(PSPC).</p>
	<p><strong>Shared Services Canada</strong> has the mandate to provide 
data centres, networks and email services to the largest government 
departments. Smaller government organizations receive these services on 
an optional basis. SSC, the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) 
and Public Safety Canada have a shared responsibility for cyber and IT 
security, with oversight provided by TBS. In addition, SSC is 
responsible for procuring hardware and software, including security 
software for workplace technology devices – the authorized physical 
devices and related software used in government office work. Departments
 and agencies are responsible for workplace technology device 
deployment, support and asset life cycle management. SSC spends $2 
billion annually on the services it provides, portions of which it 
cost-recovers from federal organizations.</p>
	<p><strong>Public Services and Procurement Canada</strong> provides IT 
services supporting back office services such as human resource 
management systems, pay and pension, enterprise records and document 
management, and financial systems and services. SSC and PSPC jointly 
support federal organizations in procuring IT goods and services.</p>
	<p><strong>Treasury Board Secretariat</strong>, supported by the Chief 
Information Officer Branch (CIOB), develops strategy and sets 
government-wide policy and mandatory requirements for IT and cyber 
security, and provides guidance on implementing the direction through 
policy implementation notices.</p>
